#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :   <u> Expository </u>
###### Assessment Method: <u> Formative Assessment</u>

<u> <b>Description:</b> </u> <u> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
Detailed theory is provided by considering all the aspects which develops intuition and deeper understanding of concepts, also reference will be provided for further information. In order to understand the process followed in simulation a complete set of procedure will be provided which helps the students to perform simulation. Step by step procedure which is carried out in lab manually is being simulated which gives exposure to real laboratory apparatus, empowering independent learning. Pre-quiz and post-quiz will be provided to test the understanding of the students before and after performing the experiments. Assignment questions will be provided to the students to make them explore more on the experiments. Once the students go through the virtual lab experiments, they can perform those experiments in real lab effectively.

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What students will do? | What Simulator will do ? | Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| See the displayed objectives and apparatus used then click on next button | Display objective, reagents and apparatus used | Recall the experiment
2.| Click on the weighing machine to set the value to zero then click on the beaker to weigh 1 gram of hydrazine sulphate, click on next button | Display take hydrazine sulphate in a beaker and measure it to 1 gram using the weighing balance | To prepare solution 1
3.| Click on the bottle containing distilled water then click on glass rod to stir the solution, click on next button | Display add 100ml distilled water to the beaker. Then stir it with glass rod | To add 100ml of distilled water to dissolve the solution
4.| Click on the weighing machine to set the value to zero then click on the beaker to weigh 10 gram of hexamethylenetetramine, click on next button | Display take hexamethylenetetramine in a beaker and measure it to 10 gram using the weighing balance | To prepare solution 2
5.| Click on the bottle containing distilled water then click on glass rod to stir the solution, click on next button | Display add 100ml distilled water to the beaker and then stir it with glass rod | To add 100ml of distilled water to dissolve the solution
