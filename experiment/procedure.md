#### These procedure steps will be followed on the simulator

1. When you click on Turbidity in Water simulation file, a new window will open as shown below, hover on "Description" and "Solutions used" label to understand the terminologies and reagents used in the experiment. Click on NEXT button to proceed.<br>
